The website stress testing tool employs diverse stress-testing techniques, including SYN flood assaults, HTTP request inundations, and gradual HTTP attacks. It aids in evaluating website durability and resilience amidst substantial traffic burdens.

## Website Stress Testing Tool Guide

### Introduction

Your website stress testing tool is designed to perform various types of stress tests on websites. It supports different attack methods, such as SYN flood attacks, HTTP request floods, and slow HTTP attacks. The tool is useful for testing the robustness and resilience of websites under heavy traffic loads.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required modules: `requests`, `colorama`, `termcolor`
  - To install these modules, you can run the following commands:
    - On Linux: `sudo pip install colorama termcolor requests`
    - On Windows: `pip install colorama requests termcolor`

### 2. Installation and Setup

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script by executing `python script_name.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify attack parameters.

### 3. Available Attack Methods

The tool offers three main attack methods:

#### a. SYN Flood Attack

This attack method sends a large number of SYN packets to exhaust the target's resources and cause a denial of service.

#### b. HTTP Request Flood Attack

This attack method sends a high volume of HTTP requests to overwhelm the target server.

#### c. Slow HTTP Attack

This attack method sends a sequence of HTTP requests at a slow pace, exploiting the target server's resource management.

### 4. Usage Examples

#### a. SYN Flood Attack

```
python script_name.py -d target_ip_or_domain -Synflood -T threads -t timeout -i spoofed_ip
```

#### b. HTTP Request Flood Attack

```
python script_name.py -d target_ip_or_domain -Request -T threads -t timeout -s sleep_time
```

#### c. Slow HTTP Attack

```
python script_name.py -d target_ip_or_domain -Pyslow -p port -T threads -t timeout -s sleep_time
```

### 5. Additional Options

- `-i spoofed_ip`: Specify a spoofed source IP address for the SYN flood attack.
- `--fakeip`: Use a fake IP address for SYN flood attacks.
- `-s sleep_time`: Set the sleep time between connections for HTTP request flood and slow HTTP attacks.
